# Neural Networks from scratch

## Problem
Build a basic neural network from scratch to fit a simple dataset

## Given
A simple dataset X along with its labels, of dimensions 12X1 is given
X = [[-1.51],
     [-1.29],
     [-1.18],
     [-0.64],
     [-0.53],
     [-0.09],
     [ 0.13],
     [ 0.35],
     [ 0.89],
     [ 1.11],
     [ 1.33],
     [ 1.44]]

y = [[0],
     [0],
     [0],
     [0],
     [1],
     [1],
     [1],
     [1],
     [0],
     [0],
     [0],
     [0]]

## Goal
Define a neural network architecture to fit the values in the dataset
